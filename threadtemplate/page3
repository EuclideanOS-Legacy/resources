[SIZE="3"]EuclideanOS stands for stability, speed and simplicity. We all have different opinions about how a perfect android operating system would be, due that, there're plenty of custom ROM's avaliable. We don't want to be just another one, but the one, mainly for the AOSP lovers. Our goal is to provide extra features and improvements into the code without compromising the stability and the performance, always looking for the best way to improve and open for opinions in order to give to the user the best android experience. Don't get stuck in the past, the future is here!![/SIZE]
